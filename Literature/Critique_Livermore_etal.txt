To analyze the change in income and poverty between 2006 and 2010, L&H conduct two-sample t-tests of proportions, with a two-sided alternative hypothesis. There are several shortcomings to this approach. Firstly, with such large sample sizes conducting a z-test or chi-square test is more appropriate, (see Statistical methods for rates and proportions by JL Fleiss, B Levin, MC Paik). In this scenario a two-tailed test will have lower power because clearly the authors were interested in a decline in the different proportions from 2006 to 2010. In L&H, their conclusion of a statistically significant difference in proportions in the poverty rates between 2006 and 2010 does not highlight the plight of the households with disability throughout the Great recession. In our study, by leveraging the longitudinal nature of the survey we fit a regression model which highlights the differences in poverty levels between different household types over the whole study period. By modeling the poverty levels over time we were able to observe the shape of the poverty level declines. In addition, we controlled for `between household' differences by using a mixed-effects model, thus reducing the bias of our estimates. We also analyzed the different household subgroups based on race, ethnicity, gender and marital status of the household head. This will help identify the subgroups that need the most attention.
