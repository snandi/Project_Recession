Kaye mentions fitting model with and without linear trends and conducting chi-square test to assess the significance of the linear trend. However, it does not show the results of any such model fit. It is not clear what kind of model fitting techniques were employed in this study. The data in Kaye's analysis is from Oct 2008 - Jun 2010, which barely overlaps with the Great recession. Our sample includes surveys from 2008 - 2013, which includes the long wake of the great recession where employment and poverty showed only modest improvement. Kaye also attempts to analyze the job exit and job aquisition rates of different racial subgroups, compared to individuals with disability. However, the analysis is limited only to a visual display of the rates. It is not accompanied by any robust and reproducible statistical analysis. In our models, we consider different population subgroups, by race, ethnicity, education, gender, marital status. By including main effects and interaction effects of these subgroups in our mixed-effects regression model we arrive at robust, unbiased estimates of poverty levels of different subgroups, as a function of time.
