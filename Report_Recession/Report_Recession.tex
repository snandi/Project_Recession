\section{Data description}
In the original dataset there were 42,030 unique households. In the disability dataset (panel 2008, wave 6), there were 33,363 households. Only those households who have responded to the survey from wave 1 through wave 15 were analyzed. In addition, if reference person of a household changed over the duration of the survey, that household was dropped. The reference person of the households also needed to be 18 or older, at the beginning of the survey. There were a total of 22,002 unique households that satisfied all the above criteria.
